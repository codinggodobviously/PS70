#### Week 3: Hand tools and fabrication, Mechanical design

Achieved: 

I created a kinetic sculpture in form of a rotating shadow lamp. 

I want to give credit to the thingiverse design I found (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1462353). I used that design to cut the material into geometric shapes. 

Initially I used this design file to cut cardboard using the laser cutter:

Then I found the little press-fit joiners flying everywhere in the laser cutter, obstructing the future cutting sequence. 

So I moved to a different material: wood. 

Initially, I thought it was success but I quickly found that it did not cut through all the way. I then realized that I did not set the thickness on the software correctly.

I did not want to waste the wood, so I turned it into a base for the motor.

Then, I successfully printed a cardboard utilizing this design (sourced from the thingiverse link above):

I started to build the lower half of the shadow lamp. I utilized scotch tape to hold the parts together before I used a hot glue gun to provide a little more support:

This is when I started on the second laser cut cardboard batch. After letting it run for a few minutes, I checked on it. This is when I saw that it caught on fire:

I was able to salvage one material from the fire. My hypothesis is that since my design required many close laser cuts, the material got too hot and caught on fire. My next cutting iteration, I took close supervision to make sure that I am present to handle the situation if it catches on fire again. 

Then the computer went through a software update and stopped the cutting process mid-way. However, I was able to salvage a few pieces and along with the wood pieces, I was able to complete the project.

I left the one face open on purpose so I can easily put in a light bulb in the future.
