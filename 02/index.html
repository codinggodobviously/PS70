#### Week 2: 2D Design and Cutting

Achieved: 

1. Created a Press-Fit Assembly Kit

  I created a press-fit assembly kit. This was achieved by following Nathan's Fusion 360 sketching tutotrial (https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/ps70/02_cutting/index) and the laser cutter at the PS70 lab. The material I used was cardboard in 4.5mm thickness.

  And the Fusion 360 sketch looks like this:

2. Modeled a screwdriver on Fusion 360

  I took measurements of a screwdriver with a caliper and modeled it on Fusion 360. This youtube tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs_CnD6-SOU) helped tremendously. 

  The finished product looks like this:

  I had two separate bodies modeled as such:

3. Modeled a tape roll on Fusion 360

  I took measurements of a tape roll with a caliper and modeled it on Fusion 360. This youtube tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2avuR0oKjQ) helped quite a bit. 

  The finished product looks like this. I had two components: tape and tape roll

Note to self: I'm thinking about pivoting my final project idea. It would be cool to create an RF blocking cloak for the guys to use. Think guille suit, but to hide your RF signature. This idea is a simple one with easier execution than say a device that hides our RF signature while still enabling us to communicate using RF. 

I want to create a new kind of body armor. This new armor will protect us not from bullets but from DFing. The idea of an RF blocking cloak is tht it will restrict all signature from exiting the cloak, much like a faraday bag. Except it will cover the entire body. Easy to throw on, like a cloak. 

More ambitious idea is creating a device that absorbs all electromagnetic waves within a certain radius. The idea is that since the device will "absorb" all electromagnetic waves (haven't worked out the mechanics), it will be impossible for our adversaries to DF. Or at least make it very difficult. Intuitively, perhaps this device can achieve this by depolarizing/hyperpolarizing electrons (opposite state of the electromagnetic wave)? More than elementary understanding in quantum physics would be helpful to achieve this goal. Maybe I can talk to someone. 

The biggest take way here is that I do not care what medium I utilize to achieve the goal, as long as I solve the exisiting problem of protecting our troops from DF.
