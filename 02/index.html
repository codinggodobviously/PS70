#### Week 2: 2D Design and Cutting

Achieved: 

1. Created a Press-Fit Assembly Kit

  I created a press-fit assembly kit. This was achieved by following Nathan's Fusion 360 sketching tutotrial (https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/ps70/02_cutting/index) and the laser cutter at the PS70 lab. The material I used was cardboard in 4.5mm thickness.

  And the Fusion 360 sketch looks like this:

2. Modeled a screwdriver on Fusion 360

  I took measurements of a screwdriver with a caliper and modeled it on Fusion 360. This youtube tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs_CnD6-SOU) helped tremendously. 

  The finished product looks like this:

  I had two separate bodies modeled as such:

3. Modeled a tape roll on Fusion 360

  I took measurements of a tape roll with a caliper and modeled it on Fusion 360. This youtube tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2avuR0oKjQ) helped quite a bit. 

  The finished product looks like this. I had two components: tape and tape roll

Notes: I'm thinking about pivoting my final project idea. It would be cool to create an RF blocking cloak for the guys to use. Think guille suit, but to hide your signal signature.
