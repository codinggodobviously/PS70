#### Week 1: Introduction 

First week of class. 

Achieved: 

1. Brain stormed initial final project ideas.

2. Created my Github porfolio page utilizing css, html, and javascript template provided as framework. 

3. Finalized final project ideas. 

Final project ideas: 

1. Type writer Marcus Aurelius AI. 

2. Defense product.

3. Biofeedback device.


Notes: First week of class. It was great to meet everyone and learn their backgrounds. I had really two options in my mind when I started the week: Marcus Aurelius AI typewriter or a defense product. 

The Marcus Aurelius typewriter is a physical manifestation of an AI that I programmed over the summer with OpenAI's API. It had conversations with users as it was Marcus Aurelius. The purpose of the AI is to act as a mentor figure giving advice aligned with Stoic principles. I wanted to take a step further and build a physical typewriter that when 1. user physically types in their queries then 2. Marcus types the answer on the paper. I received multiple feedback from users about how human Marcus AI felt. This would have taken that realism to the next level because it would be operating in the physical medium, not the digital one that Marcus AI was previously operating in. 

Another segment that I considered pursuing is the defense sector. Because of my unusual experience of spending six years as a ground special operator in the US military, I was the end user in many of the current products pushed out in the defense industries. Quite frankly, many of them are mediocre at best because unlike other sectors, the end users do not necessarily get to decide which products that they purchase. I wanted to create something that is 1. relevant to the national security issues that we are currently facing and 2. beneficial to the operators. 

The idea of biofeedback device is appealing because of the nature of its application. I believe if applied correctly, this device has huge potential to help people by alleviating suffering. I am hoping to create a device that could help with problems such as anxiety, overheating, and insomnia. I have three sepearate products in mind that address those issues separately. 

1. Wearable device that stimulates the vagus nerve.

  Drawing inspiration from existing product named "Apollo", this device would be worn on the wrist and would gently vibratie when user's heartrate rises.

2. Liquid cooling blanket. 
  
  Drawing inspiration from exisiting product named "Eight Sleep", this blanket would cool the user by the liquid cooling mechanisms sewn into the blanket. 

3. Wearable cooling forearm sleeves.

  I participated in a study while going through the special operations selection measuring effects of hands and forearm only cold water immersion on decrease in overall body temperature. Research has shown that forearm and hands only immersion is an effective way of mitigating heat injury. Anecdotally, I agree with the research. This device would effectively cool the users in risk of heat injury.
