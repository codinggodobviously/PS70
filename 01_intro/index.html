#### Week 1: Introduction 

First week of class. 

Achieved: 

1. Brain stormed initial final project ideas.

2. Created my Github porfolio page utilizing css, html, and javascript template provided as framework. 

3. Finalized final project ideas. 

Initial final project ideas: 

1. Type writer Marcus Aurelius AI. 

2. A defense product.


Finalized final project ideas:

1. Water-cooled weighted blanket.

2. Wearable device that stimulates the vagus nerve.

Notes: First week of class. It was great to meet everyone and learn their backgrounds. I had really two options in my mind when I started the week: Marcus Aurelius AI typewriter or a defense product. 

The Marcus Aurelius typewriter is a physical manifestation of an AI that I programmed over the summer with OpenAI's API. It had conversations with users as it was Marcus Aurelius. The purpose of the AI is to act as a mentor figure giving advice aligned with Stoic principles. I wanted to take a step further and build a physical typewriter that when 1. user physically types in their queries then 2. Marcus types the answer on the paper. I received multiple feedback from users about how human Marcus AI felt. This would have taken that realism to the next level because it would be operating in the physical medium, not the digital one that Marcus AI was previously operating in. 

Another segment that I considered pursuing is the defense sector. Because of my unusual experience of spending six years as a ground special operator in the US military, I was the end user in many of the current products pushed out in the defense industries. Quite frankly, many of them are mediocre at best because unlike other sectors, the end users do not necessarily get to decide which products that they purchase. I wanted to create something that is 1. relevant to the national security issues that we are currently facing and 2. beneficial to the operators. 

I decided to forego both ideas. Largely unrelated to this course, I have realized that I have been using a completely different type of framework for handling stress than the one I developed over the course of years in the Special Operations Forces. This realization happened after I came down with a terrible sickness -- searching for the root cause prompted me to reflect on my framework that I used for thinking ever since I started school last year. After I got out of military, for some reason, I decided to use a different type of framework for thinking that made me operate in a constant state of anxiety.

The selection process to be a Special Operator was long and challenging. It often involved water-based events where I voluntarily lost consciousness underwater from lack of air. Our psychologists said it was the closest thing to simulating combat, was to take away our air and see how we behave under that stress. That feeling of dread, the fact that you have just experienced the worst pain of your life and that you are going to experience it again day after day, and that not only you are going to experience it but you are going to voluntarily push yourself to experience it. This made most candidates to self-eliminate. I only stayed in the game because I developed a framework for thinking that helped me relax.

As soon as I realized that the root cause of my stress and anxiety was the shift in my framework for thinking, I took steps to reinstate the old framework. Now I am relaxed, joyful, and equipped to handle stress better. While physical tools are no substitute for psychological training, I believe creating something like a water cooled weighted blanket, or a device that stimuates your vagus nerve, can provide people with a reminder what it is like to relax.
